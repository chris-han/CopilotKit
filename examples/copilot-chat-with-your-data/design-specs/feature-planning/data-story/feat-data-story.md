let's create a new feature called 'data story', which will triggered by general sementical intent such as 'how are we
▌ doing this month'. once the intent captured, chat should provide a suggestion button to run the 'data story'
▌ sementically related to the user's intent. once user click on it, the guided-tour experience will output the data
▌ insight following 'overview->detailed analysis on significant changes->summary and call to action' scheme, showing as a
▌ a vertical timeline inside the chat, meanwhile, the related charts on the canvas will be highlighted along the tour. a
▌ 'review' button will be embeded at each section of the timeline, which will re-highlight the relevant chart.
