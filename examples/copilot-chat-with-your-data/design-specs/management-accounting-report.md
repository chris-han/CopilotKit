### 📘 Key Guidelines from AICPA & CIMA
The most relevant framework is the **Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAP)**, developed jointly by AICPA and CIMA. It’s not a rigid template, but it provides a **principled foundation** for creating management accounting reports that are:
- **Relevant**: Focused on decision-making, not just historical data
- **Reliable**: Built on robust data and transparent assumptions
- **Integrated**: Aligned with strategy, operations, and risk
- **Forward-looking**: Includes forecasts, scenarios, and strategic options

### 🧩 Typical Components in a Management Accounting Report
While formats vary by organization, a well-structured report often includes:
- **Executive Summary**: Key insights, trends, and decisions needed
- **Operational Metrics**: KPIs tied to business units or processes
- **Variance Analysis**: Budget vs. actual with commentary
- **Forecasts & Scenarios**: Rolling forecasts, what-if modeling
- **Strategic Commentary**: Risks, opportunities, and recommendations
- **Appendices**: Supporting data, assumptions, and methodology

You can find the **Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAP)** directly on the AICPA & CIMA website. The most current version is the **2nd edition**, which updates the framework to reflect modern management accounting theory and practice.

🔗 Here’s the official resource:  
- [GMAP – Global Management Accounting Principles 2nd Edition](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/gmap-global-accounting-principles)

This document outlines the four core principles:
1. **Communication provides insight**
2. **Information is relevant**
3. **Impact on value is analyzed**
4. **Stewardship builds trust**

It’s designed to help organizations align their management accounting practices with strategic decision-making, performance management, and value creation.

This format is ready to be embedded in internal docs, CI/CD pipelines, or onboarding SOPs. Want to add CLI triggers or Terraform-compatible config blocks next? I can help you wrap this into a reproducible reporting agent.

Fantastic. Here's a **CLI-compatible scaffold** that wraps your GMAP-based Markdown report into a reproducible, automation-ready agent. This version is designed for integration into CI/CD pipelines, internal reporting tools, or even GitOps workflows.

## ⚙️ GMAP Report Agent – CLI Wrapper (Bash + Markdown Hybrid)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# gmap_report.sh — Modular GMAP report generator for bilingual, audit-friendly output

# === Config ===
REPORT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LANGUAGES=("en" "zh")
AUTHOR="Finance Ops Team"
OUTPUT_FILE="gmap_report_${REPORT_DATE}.md"

# === Data Sources ===
REVENUE_GROWTH=$(curl -s http://dashboard/api/revenue | jq '.growth')
GROSS_MARGIN="42%"
CUSTOMER_RETENTION="88%"
RND_BUDGET="1200000"
RND_ACTUAL="1500000"
RND_VARIANCE=$(($RND_ACTUAL -
```
To create a **semantic layer with Python and dbt**, you’ll use a combination of:

### 🧩 YAML Configuration for Semantic Models  
This is the **core format** used by dbt’s Semantic Layer (powered by MetricFlow). Each semantic model is defined in a `.yml` file inside your dbt project. Python can be used to interact with this layer via the SDK, but the semantic definitions themselves live in YAML.

Here’s a minimal example:

```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    description: "Semantic model for order metrics"
    model: ref('orders')  # links to dbt model
    entities:
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer_id
        type: foreign
    dimensions:
      - name: order_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
      - name: region
        type: categorical
    measures:
      - name: total_revenue
        agg: sum
        expr: revenue
```

You can define multiple semantic models per dbt model, as long as each has a unique name.

---

### 🐍 Python SDK for Semantic Layer Access  
To query or interact with the semantic layer programmatically, use the [dbt Semantic Layer SDK for Python](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-sdk-python). It allows you to query metrics, group by dimensions, and integrate with pandas or polars.

Example usage:

```python
from dbtsl import SemanticLayerClient

client = SemanticLayerClient(
    environment_id=123,
    auth_token="your-token",
    host="semantic-layer.cloud.getdbt.com",
)

with client.session():
    metrics = client.metrics()
    table = client.query(
        metrics=[metrics[0].name],
        group_by=["metric_time"]
    )
    print(table.to_pandas())
```

You can also use the async version for high-throughput environments.

### 🛠️ For Your Workflow, Chris…
You could wrap this into a CLI agent that:
- Validates YAML semantic models before commit
- Auto-generates bilingual metric documentation
- Integrates with CI/CD to trigger semantic layer updates
- Converts query results to audit-friendly Markdown or YAML blocks

Want help scaffolding that CLI wrapper or building a semantic model validator with multilingual support? I can help you design it modularly.
