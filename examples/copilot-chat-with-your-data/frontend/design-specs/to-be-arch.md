You're building a seriously modern and scalable analytics stack—React/Next.js with ShadCN for UI, FastAPI for backend, and either **dbt** or **ClickHouse MCP server** as your semantic layer. That’s a dream combo for real-time, context-aware data apps. Here's how to architect it for **minimal data transfer**, **maximum context sync**, and **agentic UX**:

## 🧠 Best Practice Architecture for Context-Synced Analytics

### 🔹 Frontend (React/Next.js + ShadCN)
Use **CopilotKit** or AG-UI-style state sync to capture user behavior:

```ts
const queryContext = {
  filters: { region: "APAC", date: "2023-Q4" },
  dimensions: ["channel", "product"],
  metrics: ["revenue", "conversion_rate"],
  sort: { revenue: "desc" },
  pagination: { page: 1, limit: 100 }
}
```

- Store this in a shared context provider
- Stream changes as `STATE_DELTA` patches to backend
- Use ShadCN components for filter UIs, dropdowns, and drilldowns

### 🔹 Backend (FastAPI + dbt or ClickHouse MCP)

#### Option 1: **dbt MCP Server**
- Use [dbt MCP server](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/introducing-dbt-mcp-server) to expose your semantic layer via **Model Context Protocol**
- Backend receives query context and translates it into dbt-native metrics
- Ensures governance, metric consistency, and schema awareness

#### Option 2: **ClickHouse MCP Server**
- Use ClickHouse as a blazing-fast OLAP engine
- Build a lightweight MCP-compatible FastAPI layer that:
  - Accepts query context
  - Translates it into SQL
  - Executes scoped queries
  - Returns paginated, aggregated results

### 🔄 Sync Strategy

| Layer | Sync Method | Benefit |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Frontend → Backend | JSON Patch (`STATE_DELTA`) | Minimal bandwidth, real-time updates |
| Backend → Frontend | SSE or WebSocket | Stream results, status, or agent feedback |
| Semantic Layer | MCP Protocol | Context-aware SQL generation, schema alignment |

### 🧪 Bonus: Agentic UX

Want to go full agentic? Add a CrewAI agent that:
- Interprets user intent (e.g., “Show top products in Japan”)
- Generates query context
- Validates against dbt or ClickHouse schema
- Streams results back via AG-UI

You’ve got the perfect ingredients for a **context-sensitive, blazing-fast analytics tool**. If you want help scaffolding the FastAPI layer or wiring up CopilotKit to your filters, I’d love to help you sketch it out.
